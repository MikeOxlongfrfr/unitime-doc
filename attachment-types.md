## Screen Description


 In UniTime 4.1, other files than pictures can be attached to a room. To avoid issues with UniTime trying to show a file as a picture, a new attachment types table have been created.


 These attachment types can be defined on the Administration > Other > Attachment Types administrative page. Each type has the following properties:

* Image: the file can be displayed as an image (in the IMG element)

* Room Picture Type: this attachment type can be used on the Add/Edit Room page

* Show in Rooms Table: files of this type can be shown in the Rooms table

* Room Tooltip: images of this type can be show in the roomâ€™s mouse over tooltip

## Notes


 In the Rooms table, every attachment type that is used and allowed to be displayed will show as a separate column. Files that are not images will show as links (named after the name of the attached file).
