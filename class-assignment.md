## Screen Description

The Class Assignment screen provides interface for making changes to the current time and room assignment of a class. The changes can be made hereÂ  when no timetable is loaded (as opposed to the screens in the Solver section) since this screen only works with available times/rooms and does not provide suggestions that would include suggested changes of the assignment of other classes. The screen is accessible from the [Class Detail](class-detail) screen in case the department for this class has a committed solution (and no other solution is selected or loaded into the solver).

## Details

The first section of the screen provides an overview of the class-related information.

	* Editable in the [Multiple Class Setup](multiple-class-setup) screen

* **Enrollment**

	* Some exceptions to the norm
		* You need a room for fewer students than the class limit (Room Ratio is less than one)
		* You need a room for a class with zero limit. In this case, Room Ratio needs to contain the required room size
	* In parenthesis after the room ratio, you can see the minimum room capacity required for this class (for Class Limit <> 0, it is calculated as Room Size = Room Ratio * Class Limit; if Class Limit = 0, then Room Size = Room Ratio)
	* Editable in the [Multiple Class Setup](multiple-class-setup) screen

* **Date Pattern**
	* Days/weeks throughout the semester during which this class will be taught
	* You can click on the icon of the calendar to see which dates belong to the selected date pattern
