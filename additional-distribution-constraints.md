title: Additional Distribution Constraints
---
The following additional distribution constraint types can be added into UniTime. They are not present in UniTime out of the box as they have either a special purpose or additional parameters that need to be provided before the distribution constraint can be registered. You can see the registered distribution constraint types on the Administration > Solver > [Distribution Types](distribution-types) page.

To register any of the following constraint types:
1. Download the appropriate XML (also available in GitHub, see [Documentation/Scripts](https://github.com/UniTime/unitime/tree/master/Documentation/Scripts))
2. Use the Administration > Academic Sessions > [Data Exchange](data-exchange) page to import it. This will create a script that will register the appropriate distribution type(s).
3. Use the Administration > Utilities > [Scripts](scripts) page to run the registration script. The script is named Distribution Types: Create XXX Constraints, where XXX is the constraint name.
4. Verify that the distribution types have been registered using the Administration > Solver > Distribution Types page.

### Max Block

Script: [Create Max Block Constraint.xml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UniTime/unitime/master/Documentation/Scripts/Create%20Max%20Block%20Constraint.xml)

The MaxBlock constraint checks for too big blocks of back-to-back classes of an instructor on a day.

It has two parameters: a maximal length of a back-to-back block that is allowed and a minimum length of a break between two classes not to be considered in the same block.

Reference `_MaxBlock:120:30_` translates to a maximal block of at most 2 hours (120 minutes) with classes not more than 30 minutes apart.

Implemented by the [MaxBlockFlexibleConstraint](https://github.com/UniTime/cpsolver/blob/master/src/org/cpsolver/coursett/constraint/MaxBlockFlexibleConstraint.java) class.

### Max Break

Script: [Create Max Break Constraint.xml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UniTime/unitime/master/Documentation/Scripts/Create%20Max%20Break%20Constraint.xml)

The MaxBreaks constraint limits the number of blocks of non back-to-back classes of an instructor on a day.

It has two parameters: a maximal number of breaks and a minimal length of a break between two classes not to be considered in the same block.

Reference `_MaxBreaks:1:30_` translates to a maximum number of one break (two blocks) on a day of classes not more than 30 minutes apart.

Implemented by the [MaxBreaksFlexibleConstraint](https://github.com/UniTime/cpsolver/blob/master/src/org/cpsolver/coursett/constraint/MaxBreaksFlexibleConstraint.java) class.

### Max Holes

Script: [Create Max Holes Constraint.xml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UniTime/unitime/master/Documentation/Scripts/Create%20Max%20Holes%20Constraint.xml)

The MaxHoles constraint limits the number of free time (holes) for an instructor on a day.

It has one parameter: a maximal amount of free time in minutes (between the first and the last class on a day) that an instructor is allowed to have without a penalization.

For example, reference `_MaxHoles:120_` translates to a maximum number of two hours of total free time between the first and the last class on a day.

If required, having more free time is prohibited. If preferred or strongly preferred, the excessive free time is penalized.

Implemented by the [MaxHolesFlexibleConstraint](https://github.com/UniTime/cpsolver/blob/master/src/org/cpsolver/coursett/constraint/MaxHolesFlexibleConstraint.java) class.

### Max Hours A Day

Script: [Create Max Hours A Day Constraint.xml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UniTime/unitime/master/Documentation/Scripts/Create%20Max%20Hours%20A%20Day%20Constraints.xml)

Classes must / should be placed in no more than N week days.

The MaxDays constraint limits the number of days of week during which the given set of classes are taught.

It has one parameter: a maximal number of week days during which the given set of classes can be placed.

Reference `_MaxDays:2_` translates to a maximum number of 2 days a week.

Implemented by the [MaxDaysFlexibleConstraint](https://github.com/UniTime/cpsolver/blob/master/src/org/cpsolver/coursett/constraint/MaxDaysFlexibleConstraint.java) class.

### Max Half-Days

Script: [Create Max Half-Days Constraints.xml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UniTime/unitime/master/Documentation/Scripts/Create%20Max%20Half-Days%20Constraints.xml)

Classes must / should be placed in no more than N week half-days. A class starting before noon is considered a morning class, a class starting at noon or later is considered an afternoon class.

The MaxHalfDays constraint limits the number of half-days of week during which the given set of classes are taught.

It has one parameter: a maximal number of week half-days during which the given set of classes can be placed.

A day is split by noon (which can be changed using `General.HalfDaySlot` parameter). A class starting before noon is considered a morning class (despite of its end), a class starting at noon or later is considered an afternoon class.

Reference `_MaxHalfDays:4_` translates to a maximum number of 4 half-days a week.

Implemented by the [MaxHalfDaysFlexibleConstraint](https://github.com/UniTime/cpsolver/blob/master/src/org/cpsolver/coursett/constraint/MaxHalfDaysFlexibleConstraint.java) class.

### Max Weeks

Script: [Create Max Weeks Constraint.xml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UniTime/unitime/master/Documentation/Scripts/Create%20Max%20Weeks%20Constraint.xml)

The MaxWeeks constraint limits the number of weeks during which the given set of classes are taught.

It has two parameters: a maximal number of weeks during which the given set of classes can be placed and a day combination indicating what days of the week are considered.If no days of the week are selected, all days of the week are considered.

Reference `_MaxWeeks:3:6_` translates to a maximum number of 3 weeks, but only for classes that are placed on Fridays and Saturdays (64 for Monday, 32 for Tuesday, 16 for Wednesday, 8 for Thursday, 4 for Friday, 2 for Saturday, and 1 for Sunday). If the second parameter is zero, all days of week are considered.

There should be at least the given number of hours between an evening class followed by a morning class the next day.

The constraint can also be parameterized by the distance between the two classes: The constraint only triggers when the distance between the two classes is over the provided distance.
