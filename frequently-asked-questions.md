1. How do I book times in a classroom for faculty meetings?

	Set it up as a 900 level course called Faculty Meetings with time and room that should be booked for these meetings.

2. How do I look up an instructor? One of my instructors has been teaching for us already, but I have not been able to look her PUID up by name.

	If you cannot find an instructor (who has already been teaching here) by last name, try their career account.
