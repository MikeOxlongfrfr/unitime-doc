## Screen Description


 The Edit Role page can be used to change an existing role or to delete it. Such a role can be assigned to UniTime managers ([Timetable Managers](timetable-managers) page) or instructors ([Instructor Roles](instructor-roles) page). Permissions of a role can be defined on the [Permissions](permissions) page. See [Roles](roles) page for more details.


 The user needs to have Role Edit permission to be able to edit roles. A role can be only deleted if there is no instructor or manager using the role. The four basic roles (anonymous, no role, student, and instructor) cannot be deleted.

## Details


 A role has a reference and a name. When Instructor toggle is checked, the role can be assigned to an instructor (or any departmental personell) using the Instructor Roles page. When the toggle is unchecked, the role can be only used on the [Timetable Managers](timetable-managers) page. Roles that are not enabled can be assigned to managers (or instructors), but they will not get assigned to the authenticated users.

## Operations


 Click **Save** to update the modified role. Button **Back** will get you back to [Roles](roles) page without making any changes. Click **Delete** to delete the role.


 The buttons **Previous** and **Next** can be used to save the current role and get to the Edit Role page for the previous / next role.
