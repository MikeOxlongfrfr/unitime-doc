Users with Event Lookup Schedule permission can lookup a schedule of another person using the **Lookup** button.

A useful feature is the ability to export the personal examination schedule as an iCalendar URL that can be inserted in your favourite calendar application and that always returns an up-to-date calendar. To get the URL, select the Export iCalendar option under the **Export** button. The following dialog appears and the url can be copied into the clipboard.

**Note:** The personal examination schedule is available for students and instructors only if the academic session is in a status that includes no-role midterm exam schedule and / or final exam schedule (the status type's properties can be changed in the [Edit Status Type](edit-status-type) screen).
