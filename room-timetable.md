## Screen Description


 Room Timetable page is a variant of the [Events](events) page that allows to see a timetable of a particular room.


 Besides of the ability to filter events and rooms (see description of the [Event Filter](events-event-filter) and [Room Filter](events-room-filter)), the page allows to select a particular **resource type**. Besides of a Room Timetable (in which case the page works exactly like the [Events](events) page and a particular room can be selected in the [Room Filter](events-room-filter)) one of the following options can be selected:

* Subject Timetable (all class, examination, and course related events of a subject area or a course offering)

* Curriculum Timetable (all class, examination, and course related events of a curriculum)

* Departmental Timetable (all class, examination, and course related events of a department)

* Personal Timetable (all events of a person)

## Subject Timetable


 When the Resource Type it changed to Subject Timetable, one can see all class, examination, and course related events that are related to a particular subject area or a course offering. The subject area or course can be entered in the Subject field.

To get the URL, select the Copy iCalendar URL option under the **Export** button. The following dialog appears and the url can be copied into the clipboard.
