## Screen Description

The Edit Teaching Responsibilities page can be used to create, modify, or delete existing teaching responsibilities using a single page. Both instructor and coordinator assignment can have a teaching responsibility defined (optional). This allows, for instance, to distinguish between instructors, teaching assistants, course supervisors, graders, and other roles.

The user needs to have Teaching Responsibility Edit permission to be able to edit teaching responsibilities. See [Teaching Responsibilities](teaching-responsibilities) for more details.

## Details

Beside of reference, name, and abbreviation, there is a flag defining whether the responsibility can be used on an instructor (Instructor column), on a coordinator (Coordinator column), whether the assignment should be visible in the reports (Auxiliary), not visible in the event management (Hide in Events) or not exported / sent to an external system (No Export).

## Operations

Click **Save** to save the teaching responsibilities. The button **Back** will get you back to [Teaching Responsibilities](teaching-responsibilities) page without making any changes. A new line can be added by clicking on the green plus button, a line (and the appropriate teaching responsibility) can be deleted by clicking the red x button.

Please note that the teaching responsibilities that cannot be deleted do not have the red x button. These are the responsibilities that are already being used.
