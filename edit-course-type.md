## Screen Description


 The Edit Course Type can be used to change a course type or to delete it. Course types can be used to categorize course offerings. The user needs to have Course Type Edit permission to be able to edit course types. See [Course Types](course-types) for more details.

## Details


 A course type has an abbreviation and a name defined. Both abbreviations and names have to be unique.


 A course type that is being used (i.e., there is a course offering of the type) cannot be deleted.

## Operations


 Click **Save** to update the modified type. Button **Back** will get you back to [Course Types](course-types) page without making any changes. Click **Delete** to delete the type.


 The buttons **Previous** and **Next** can be used to save the current course type and get to the Edit Course Type page for the previous / next type.
