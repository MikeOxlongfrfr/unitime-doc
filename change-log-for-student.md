## Screen Description

The Change log for (student's name) pop-up window presents a history of changes performed during the student scheduling process. The table is the same as the Change Log table in the [Online Student Scheduling Dashboard](online-student-scheduling-dashboard) screen when the filter is set to "student: student's name" in that screen.
