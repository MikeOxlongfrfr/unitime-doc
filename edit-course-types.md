## Screen Description

The Edit Course Types page can be used to create, modify, or delete existing course types using a single page. Course types can be used to categorize course offerings. The user needs to have Course Type Edit permission to be able to edit course types. See [Course Types](course-types) for more details.

## Details

A course type has an abbreviation and a name defined. Both abbreviations and names have to be unique.

A course type that is being used (i.e., there is a course offering of the type) cannot be deleted.

## Operations

Click **Save** to save the course types. The button **Back** will get you back to [Course Types](course-types) page without making any changes. A new line can be added by clicking on the green plus button, a line (and the appropriate course type) can be deleted by clicking the red x button.

Please note that the course types that cannot be deleted do not have the red x button.
